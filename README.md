# sbb-icons

Icon repository for the SBB organization.

The icons in this repository will be published to the icon CDN,
which is used by the UI libraries in this organization.

The `@sbb-esta/icons` npm package contains all SVG icons as files and provides a list of available
icons via root export.

```ts
import { CircleCrossSmall } from '@sbb-esta/icons';

console.log(CircleCrossSmall); // circle-cross-small
```
